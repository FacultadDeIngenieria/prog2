# Instructions

Given a number, find the sum of all the unique multiples of particular numbers up to
but not including that number.

If we list all the natural numbers below 20 that are multiples of 3 or 5,
we get 3, 5, 6, 9, 10, 12, 15, and 18.

The sum of these multiples is 78.



Implement this 3 times:

    1. by using iteration syntax (for, while)
    2. by using higher order functions
    3. by using higher order functiones implemented by you

For `3` what we expect is that you implement your own versions of `map`, `filter`, `reduce` or any other function you used for `2`

_You can use iteration for implementing this HOF_
