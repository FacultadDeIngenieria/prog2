# Second Grade Equation

## Instructions

You have to solve a Second grade equation of the form **ax<sup>2</sup> + bx + c**.

You should return a `Tuple[float, float]` with the 2 roots (x<sub>1</sub> and x<sub>2</sub>).

If the equation has only one real solution then both roots will have the same value.


## For Example


`solve(2, 0, 0)` should return `(0, 0)`
